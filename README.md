# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is a Machine Learning model built using Python to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived or not based on different features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous **Titanic dataset**, which includes information about passengers such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children (Parch)
- Fare
- Embarked
- Survival (Target Variable)

## Project Steps
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
